		<h2>History</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> The founder and executive director, Ashley McEwen, is from Nashville, TN. As a product of youth development programs, she understands the importance and need of proper mentorship and guidance for children to grow into successful adults. While working in the fields of youth development and education, she was made painfully aware of the lack of effective youth programs and the alarming increase of youth in need of support and guidance. Through multiple life changing encounters with youth she was serving, she realized that she had an integral part to play in the cultivation of the hearts and minds of youth. Thus Crowns Up! was birthed to educate, expose, and empower our future leaders.

		<h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
			 After multiple life-changing encounters with young people in her hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, Crowns Up! Founder and Executive Director, Ashley McEwen was divinely entrusted with a special assignment. A product of youth development programming herself, she understood firsthand the importance and need for proper mentorship, as well as the impact that authentic guidance has on youth and their growth into successful adults. It was with this mindset that Crowns Up! was first realized and a community of support was formed.</p>
			
		
			<p>
			As a youth development and education professional for over ten years, McEwen was keenly aware that there was a lack of effective youth programs available to the youth of her community. Moreover, she was innately and spiritually motivated to play a more integral role in the cultivation of the hearts and minds of young people who needed her most. With prayer and patience, though seemingly all at once, it was revealed to her what she was required to do. The number of youth in need of support and guidance was increasing at an alarming rate, and the time to act was now.</p>
			
		
			<p>
			Thus, Crowns Up! was birthed to educate, expose, and empower our future leaders of tomorrow. Through expansive programming, enrichment experiences, mentorship, volunteerism, and the unwavering love of God, Crowns Up! will guide young girls through adolescence and into their rightful place as the queens of their destiny. “Most young people just need a chance to be heard, an opportunity to explore who they are – an ignited belief in their own future,” proclaims McEwen. “We are here to hold their Crown’s up so that they see their truest self as excellence. We will bear their Crown’s until they are victorious. We will not fail our youth.”

			Ashley McEwen
            
			Bio - Hey y’all! I’m from Nashville, TN. I completed my undergraduate studies at Middle Tennessee State University with a degree in Health Education. I reCceived my Master of Public Health degree from the University of Louisville. I love to laugh, play games with friends and family, play basketball, and eat! I’m often described as the “adventurous one”. Since I’m the baby sister, I’m also down with anything that is a competition! 
            Why Crowns Up!? - I am a part of Crowns Up! because I’m a product of youth development, and more specifically, youth development in the city of Nashville. I recognize how mentorship changed my life and I want to provide that for others. I want to show young people that you can love God and still be cool, an alternative to what is common in our community.
